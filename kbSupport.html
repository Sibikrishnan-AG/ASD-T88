                                    <b>1. Denialiability - A defensive disbelief </b><br>
                                    Before learning of the diagnosis, families might not notice the subtle symptoms in their child, especially since these signs 
                                    are often associated with hyperactivity and misinterpreted as signs of a social and bright personality. 
                                    In some cases, children may show stable growth during infancy, but experience a significant developmental regression only when they reach preschool age.<br><br>

                                    Families will find it challenging to accept the diagnosis after previously experiencing their child’s behaviors to more positive traits and development.
                                    This contrast between perceived normality and sudden developmental regression can be emotionally jarring. Parents may struggle with feelings of shock, grief, and confusion. Therefore, 
                                    making it harder to come to terms with the diagnosis.<br><br>

                                    <b>2. Change in lifestyle </b><br>
                                    Families often have specific expectations for the life they envision for their child and themselves. 
                                    A special needs diagnosis drastically shifts these expectations. 
                                    They may no longer live the "normal" life they imagined, now facing additional emotional and logistical 
                                    challenges such as communication difficulties and increased financial demands from medical treatments, therapies, and specialized schooling. 
                                    These lifestyle changes can lead to denial, as families struggle to reconcile their hopes with the new reality of raising a child with special needs.<br><br>


                                    <b>3. Compounding stress</b><br>
                                    In addition to the second point, some families may already be facing challenges like financial problems, 
                                    single-parent households, or poor living conditions, which adds more stress when caring for a special needs child.<br><br>

                                    <b>So why is acceptance necessary?</b>
                                    Accepting your child's condition allows you to embrace your child’s differences, helping to strengthen your bond and build a supportive environment. 
                                    By coming to terms with their child’s condition, 
                                    you and your family can better focus on their child’s strengths, 
                                    advocate for necessary resources and navigate challenges with a more positive mindset.
                                    This foster a sense of belonging and confidence for your child,
                                    improving overall well-being for both the child and the family

                                </p>

                                    1. Give yourself the space to care for your emotions and process your feelings. Acceptance is a journey, giving yourself grace and time can help you process them.<br><br>
                                    2. Find solace and support from others by sharing about your journey or feelings to a trusted family member, friends or professionals.<br><br>
                                    3. Don’t be hard on yourself. This journey is challenging, and self-compassion is essential for both you and your child’s well-being. Remember, this isn’t a journey you will face alone—there’s support available from others who understand.<br><br>
                                    4. Educate yourself on the condition your child is dealing with, having a good understanding of what your child is experiencing can replace fear or uncertainty with knowledge and confidence.<br><br>
                                    5. Involve your child in your life by focusing on their strengths and including them in meaningful activities and conversations, helping them feel empowered and strengthening your bond.

                                    Families of children with special needs often don’t neglect their mental health intentionally; 
                                    rather, the demands of caring for their child leave them with little time or energy to focus on themselves. 
                                    As a result, many find it difficult to prioritize their own well-being. 
                                    Additionally, cost barriers and lack of access to mental health resources or community support for families in these situations contributes to why their mental health is often overlooked.

                                    can create unnecessary stress on.  It is often overlooked that a child's well-being and learning opportunities are largely influenced by the family environment.
                                    Parental mental health shapes behaviors that impact the child, while the child's behavior also influences the parents' actions, creating a reciprocal dynamic.
