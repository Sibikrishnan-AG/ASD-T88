                                    Studies have indicated that aggression behavior is commonly observed among children with autism.
                                    They exhibit problematic behavioural challenges such as extreme temper tantrum, self-injury, anxiety and fearfulness, and disruptive
                                    behaviour towards their peers. Aggression, whether self-directed or aimed at others, can lead to physical and emotional distress for both the child and caregivers. 
                                    Unsurprisingly, it's a frequent concern raised by both parents and educators, but addressing this behavior can be challenging. 
                                    This is because children with autism often struggle to understand the consequences of their actions or lack the communication skills needed to express their feelings in healthier ways. 
                                </p>

                                        Some factors that contribute to this behavior are:<br>
                                            • Senory overload and sensitivities. Children with autism are highly sensitive to stimuli such as loud noises, bright or flickering lights, crowded environments, and physical contact. 
                                                These stimuli can act as triggers, causing the child to exhibit behaviors such as increased body movement (jumping, clapping, running), repetitive actions, meltdowns, or speaking rapidly in gibberish.<br>
                                            • Difficulty in expressing their emotions verbally. When unable to articulate their feelings, children may resort to using strong gestures or actions to communicate, such as throwing objects to express excitement.<br>
                                            • Medical conditions that causes discomfort that the child feels but unable to describe it themselves (e.g. ear infection, dental issues, digestion issues)

                                    1. Validate their concerns and emotions by listening to your child. Often times the cause of their behaviour might be related to the issues they're facing that isn't obvious from the surface.
                                        Try to understand what they are dealing with and work together to resolve them.<br>
                                    2. Introduce sensory tools or fidget toys to prevent child from hurting themselves or others when over-stimulated.<br>
                                    3. Teach your child some coping strategies for managing their emotions whenever they are feeling overwhelmed. Some examples are deep breathing exercises, squeezing a stress ball, or using visual cues to help your child indicate when they need a break to calm down.<br>x 
                                    4. Consult professionals such as behavioral specialists or occupational therapists, who can provide medical guidance and tailored strategies to help manage aggressive behavior effectively.<br>

                                    Ever wondered why there are special needs schools designed specifically for children with autism?
                                    That's because children with autism and other developmental conditions often have different learning styles compared to their neurotypical peers.
                                    These children have a unique way to processing and understanding information, they have their own perspective on interacting with their surroundings, 
                                    which affects how they engage in learning, play, and social situations.
                                    In addtion, they have difficulties with information retention due to their sensory overload tendencies. 
                                    When overwhelmed by sensory input, their ability to concentrate on and process information can be hindered.

                                    Failure to apprehend situations that are going on around them. Their primary motivation is to satisfy themselves, rather than others.<br><br>

                                    <b>2. Little to no social and emotional reciprocity</b><br>
                                    Unable to or does not know how to demostrate more complex emotions like sympathy, empathy, thankfulness, or pleasing others. They also do not know
                                    how to respond to praises and affection. There are also signs of them not aware of the effect caused by their behaviour to themselves and others.<br><br>

                                    <b>3. Difficulty in understanding body language and facial expression</b><br>
                                    They are unlikely to respond or acknowledge to both positive and negative actions that are meant to influence a certain reaction or behaviour.
                                    E.g. Using hand gestures to show annoyance but autistic children won't be able to comprehend the meaning of it.<br><br>

                                    <b>4. Expressing their emotions or thoughts using "uncommon" body language or facial expressions</b><br>
                                    E.g. Some autistic children will show excitement or positive mood by shaking their legs and rocking back and forth.<br><br>
