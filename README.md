# CM2020 Agile Software Projects 

This module aims to provide insights and practice in software development using contemporary
methods to produce software that meets the needs of users and supports an organisationâ€™s business
function. The module will enable you to gain competence in the conceptualisation of a technologybased solution to a real-world problem, fulfilling the requirements of users and taking constraints
imposed by the prevailing and foreseen market conditions and lessons learned from prototypes into
account.

## About Empath Interact E.I
Our project - Empath Interact, aims to develop a mobile application to support Singaporean parents and caregivers, especially first-timers, of young children (ages 0-6) recently diagnosed with neurodevelopmental disorders like ADHD and Autism (ASD). The project addresses the ongoing challenges these families face, including stigma, discrimination, and mental health pressures due to the demands of caring for a child with special needs. By offering targeted support, the solution seeks to ease the burden during the transition and acceptance phase, enhancing the well-being of both the families and their children.
